# ArbiCats

A hobby project to familiarize myself with svelte, daisyUI and dynamic URI NFT's.

## How To Play 

Connect your wallet to [Arbitrum Goerli testnet](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_chains), pess the connect wallet button and then press the mint button to recieve an ArbiCat.

Take care of your ArbiCat; feed it, play with it and pass time. You will see your cats' attributes evolve as you engage with it.

Note: Each address can only mint 1 Cat, you may need some test [ETH](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=ok%20I%20need%20@arbitrum%20to%20give%20me%20Nitro%20testnet%20gas.%20like%20VERY%20SOON.%20I%20cant%20take%20this,%20I%E2%80%99ve%20been%20waiting%20for%20@nitro_devnet%20release.%20I%20just%20want%20to%20start%20developing.%20but%20I%20need%20the%20gas%20IN%20MY%20WALLET%20NOW.%20can%20devs%20DO%20SOMETHING??%20%20SEND%20HERE:%200xAddA0B73Fe69a6E3e7c1072Bb9523105753e08f8).

Contributions are welcome, however, this was created as an aside.

```bash
# install the dependencies
npm i

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
