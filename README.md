# ArbiCats

A hobby project to familiarize myself with svelte, daisyUI and dynamic URI NFT's.

## How To Play 

Connect your wallet to Arbitrum Goerli testnet, pess the connect wallet button and then press the mint button to recieve an ArbiCat.

Take care of your ArbiCat; feed it, play with it and pass time. You will see your cats' attributes evolve as you engage with it.

Note: Each address should only mint 1 Cat.


## Developing

Contributions are welcome, however, this was created as an aside.

```bash
# install the dependencies
npm i

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, head to vercel or surge.
